# Employee Directory UI

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Use a Freemarker-compatible environment (e.g., Apache FreeMarker + Java, or simulate Freemarker tags for static preview)
3. Open `index.ftl` and `form.ftl` in a browser if locally viewing

## Features
- Dashboard view with employee listing
- Add/Edit form with validation
- Search, filter, and sort
- Local JavaScript data handling (no backend)
- Freemarker templates for rendering
- Responsive design

## Challenges
- Integrating Freemarker with frontend-only logic
- Keeping UI modular with no backend

## Improvements
- Would add localStorage to persist data between reloads
- Add modal popups instead of separate form page
